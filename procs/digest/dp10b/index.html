      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/testaro">Testaro</a> application used its <code>tp10</code> testing procedure to test the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/"><dfn>accessibility</dfn></a> (barrier-free design and coding) of the __org__ web page at <a href="__url__">__url__</a> on __dateSlash__. The procedure performed 808 tests. Of these, 16 are custom tests defined by Testaro, and the others belong to six other packages of tests:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/aatt">AATT</a> by PayPal running <a href="https://marketplace.squiz.net/extensions/html-codesniffer">HTMLCodeSniffer</a> by Squiz</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/Siteimprove/alfa">Alfa</a> by Siteimprove</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/axe-core">Axe-core</a> by Deque</li>
        <li><a href="https://github.com/IBMa/equal-access">Equal Access</a> by IBM</li>
        <li><a href="https://tenon.io/documentation/apiv2.php">Tenon</a> by Level Access</li>
        <li><a href="https://wave.webaim.org/api/">WAVE</a> by WebAIM</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Testaro produced a report enumerating the test results.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/testilo">Testilo</a> used its <code>sp10b</code> scoring procedure to compute partial and total scores for the page. The total score is __totalScore__ (where 0 is the best possible score). The scored report is appended below.</p>
      <p>Finally, Testilo used procedure <code>dp10b</code> to produce this digest, explaining how <code>sp10b</code> computed the scores.</p>
      <h2>Score summary</h2>
      <table class="allBorder secondCellRight">
        <caption>Score components</caption>
        <tbody class="headersLeft">
        __scoreRows__
        </tbody>
      </table>
      <h2>Issue summary</h2>
      <h3>Special issues</h3>
      __specialSummary__
      <h3>Classified issues</h3>
      <p>The classified issues reported by tests are summarized below.</p>
      __groupSummary__
      <h2>Discussion</h2>
      <p>Although there are widely accepted <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/">accessibility standards</a>, there is still no unanimity about how to define, test, and quantify accessibility. The failures reported in this digest merit investigation as <strong>potential</strong> opportunities for improved accessibility. But you may conclude that some of the failures do not actually harm accessibility, and some substantial accessibility faults can escape detection by any of these tests. Likewise, you may disagree with weightings and formulas of scoring procedure <code>sp10b</code>, or question whether it is appropriate even to assign accessibility scores to a web page. This digest describes only one interpretation of the page&rsquo;s accessibility. You can modify and extend Testaro and Testilo to fit other understandings.</p>
      <p>Scoring procedure <code>sp10b</code> bases scores on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>how many categories of issues were reported</li>
        <li>how many issues were reported per category</li>
        <li>the largest count of issues of a category reported by a single test</li>
        <li>how many tests reported the issues</li>
        <li>how important each issue is deemed to be</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Most issues are simply counted, but some are complex and get a <q>count</q> that is really the result of a formula. The exact rules for scoring are in the <a href="https://github.com/jrpool/testilo/blob/main/procs/score/sp10b.js"><code>sp10b.js</code> file</a> that performs the scoring.</p>
      <p>Weights used in the calculations are contained in the appended report in the <code>score</code> block. The <code>groupWeights</code> block within it contains the weights applied to the classified issues, and the <code>countWeights</code> block within it contains the amounts those weights are multiplied by or added to. For example, if <code>roleBad</code> issues are reported, the <code>roleBad</code> score is the <code>absolute</code> amount (2), plus the largest count of those issues reported by any test multiplied by the <code>largest</code> amount (1), plus the total count of those issues reported by all other tests multiplied by the <code>smaller</code> amount (0.4), all multiplied by the <code>roleBad</code> weight (3).</p>
