      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The <code>tsp10</code> <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/">accessibility</a> testing procedure was executed by <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/testaro">Testaro</a> on 1 web pages. The procedure performed 808 tests on each page. Of these, 16 tests are custom tests defined by Testaro, and the others belong to packages of tests created by others. Testaro produced reports enumerating the test results.</p>
      <p>These tests&mdash;like all tests&mdash;are fallible. The failures described in the reports merit investigation as <strong>potential</strong> opportunities for improved accessibility. But some reported faults may not actually harm accessibility, and some accessibility faults can escape detection by any of these tests.</p>
      <p>Given the reports produced by Testaro, another procedure, <code>tsp10a</code>, assigned weights to the tests and computed a total score for each page (where 0 is the best possible score), adding a section on scoring to each report. Just as tests are fallible, any scoring procedure is subjective, and different reasonable procedures could assign different scores on the basis of the same report.</p>
      <p>A third procedure, <code>tdp10a</code>, created a digest from each report, summarizing the tests and how the score was computed. The report for each page is appended to the page&rsquo;s digest.</p>
      <p>This page, produced by the <code>ttp0</code> procedure, lists the tested web pages, in order of their scores (best to worst). The comparative table includes links to the pages and to the digests.</p>
