      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The <code>tp10</code> <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/">accessibility</a> testing procedure was executed by <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/testaro">Testaro</a> on 1 web pages. The procedure performed 808 tests on each page. Of these, 16 tests are custom tests defined by Testaro, and the others belong to packages of tests created by others. Testaro produced reports enumerating the test results.</p>
      <p>Given the reports produced by Testaro, another application, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/testilo">Testilo</a>, used its <code>sp10a</code> procedure to assigned weights to the tests and compute a total score for each page (where 0 is the best possible score), adding a section on scoring to each report.</p>
      <p>Testilo used a third procedure, <code>dp10a</code>, to create a digest from each report, summarizing the tests and how the score was computed. The report for each page is included, as an appendix, in the page&rsquo;s digest.</p>
      <p>Testilo produced this comparison page with a fourth procedure, <code>cp0</code>, listing the tested web pages in order of their scores (best to worst) and showing their scores in a table. The table includes links to the pages and to the digests.</p>
      <p>Tests and scoring formulae are fallible and subjective. The reported faults merit investigation as potential opportunities for improved accessibility. But some may not actually harm accessibility, and some other accessibility faults may have escaped detection by any of the tests. Different reasonable procedures could yield different test results and different scores. Both Testaro and Testilo can be customized to fit different definitions and weightings of types of accessibility.</p>
