        <div id="synopsis">
          <p>Page: Railpass</p>
          <p>URL: https://www.railpass.com/</p>
          <p>Score: 1105</p>
          <p>Tested by: Testaro, procedure <code>tp10</code></p>
          <p>Scored by: Testilo, procedure <code>sp10b</code></p>
          <p>Digested by: Testilo, procedure <code>dp10b</code></p>
        </div>
      </header>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The <code>tp10</code> <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/accessibility-intro/">accessibility</a> testing procedure was executed by <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/testaro">Testaro</a> on the Railpass web page at <a href="https://www.railpass.com/">https://www.railpass.com/</a>, on 2022/06/03. The procedure performed 808 tests. Of these, 16 tests are custom tests defined by Testaro, and the others belong to packages of tests created by others. Testaro produced a report enumerating the test results.</p>
      <p><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/testilo">Testilo</a> used its <code>sp10b</code> scoring procedure to compute partial and total scores for the page. The total score is 1105 (where 0 is the best possible score). The scored report is appended below.</p>
      <p>Finally, Testilo used procedure <code>dp10b</code> to produce this digest, explaining how <code>sp10b</code> computed the scores.</p>
      <p>Disclaimer: Even though there are widely accepted accessibility standards, there is still no unanimity about how to define, test for, and quantify accessibility. The failures reported below merit investigation as <strong>potential</strong> opportunities for improved accessibility. But you may conclude that some of the failures do not actually harm accessibility, and some substantial accessibility faults can escape detection by any of these tests. Likewise, you may not agree with weightings and formulas of scoring procedure <code>sp10b</code>, or even question whether it is appropriate to assign accessibility scores to a web page. This digest describes only one interpretation of the page&rsquo;s accessibility.</p>

      <h2>Issue summary</h2>
      <h3>Special issues</h3>
      <p><span class="componentID">log</span>: Score 34. This is based on the amount of browser logging during the tests. Browsers usually log messages only when pages contain erroneous code.
